### Nested Schema for `items`

Required:

- `package` (String) Package name (with .deb) from package in File manager or package name (without .deb ending) to install it from a apt repository configured on the device (e.g. mc for midnight commander will install from repository)

Optional:

- `parameters` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--parameters))
- `pre_condition` (String) Script/executable that needs to return successfully before software package is installed. We expect 0 or true. We assume true if left empty. For example, call: /bin/true or finish with exit(0)
- `service_name` (String) Define a service name if it differs from the package name. If empty then service name will be assumed to be the same as the package name

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Softwaremanagement can be imported by specifying the type (tag or node), followed by a colon, and
# finally either the tag or the node id.
terraform import qbee_softwaremanagement.example tag:example_tag
terraform import qbee_softwaremanagement.example node:example_node
```
