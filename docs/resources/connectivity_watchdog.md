## Schema

### Required

- `extend` (Boolean) If the configuration should extend configuration from the parent nodes of the node the configuration is applied to. If set to false, configuration from parent nodes is ignored.
- `threshold` (Number) defines how many consecutive failed pings are allowed before the watchdog triggers a reboot.

### Optional

- `node` (String) The node for which to set the configuration. Either tag or node is required.
- `tag` (String) The tag for which to set the configuration. Either tag or node is required.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# qbee_connectivity_watchdog can be imported by specifying the type (tag or node), followed by a
# colon, and finally either the tag or the node id.
terraform import qbee_connectivity_watchdog.example_tag tag:example-tag
terraform import qbee_connectivity_watchdog.example_node node:example-node-id
```
